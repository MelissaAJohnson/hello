                    <p>I am a <span>Web Developer</span> who thrives on simple design and the best user experience. My hobbies include getting lost in design and coding blogs and books. I love to discover and learn - making working in technology a passion and not just a job.</p>

                    Although I live in rural USA, I'm used to working with teams distributed across the globe. I have the luxury of traveling internationally to see my team every year. We've been to places such as Thailand and recently, Berlin.

                    I have a passion for learning. I like to be surrounded by smart people and working in a field that constantly changes. At the risk of sounding boring, I consider learning to code a hobby and like to spend as much of my spare time doing it as possible.

                <div class="div-3 flex-items">
                    What makes me a valuable partner is I have a lot of experience delivering web and mobile solutions. I'm new to coding them but I've been successfuly directing development teams for over 10 years. I'm turning a new leaf - becoming a maker more than manager.
